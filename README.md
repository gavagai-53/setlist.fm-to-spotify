# setlist.fm-to-spotify
Web app to take setlists from Setlist.fm and make Spotify playlists. You can see it in action <a href="http://jrloaiza.me/concerts/">here</a>.

This app uses the <a href="https://api.setlist.fm/">Setlist.fm API</a> to get a setlist for a given concert, and passes it to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a> to give you a playlist for that setlist.</p>

Special thanks to Paul Lamere and contributors who wrote the <a href="http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Spotipy</a> wrapper to handle the Spotify API through Python.
